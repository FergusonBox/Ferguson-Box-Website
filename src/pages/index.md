Ferguson Box has a combined 60 years of values and tradition with a commitment to packaging done right.  

Since 1959, Ferguson Box has had a presence in the corrugated packaging business in the Southeast.  We’ve served our customers and employees through growth in size as well as through expansion of services.  With over 183,000 square feet of manufacturing space in southwest Charlotte, Ferguson Box offers state-of-the-art machinery and equipment along with graphic and structural expertise. Yet, we still retain our hardworking roots and accessibility to owners and management.

We’re following our founding beliefs of focusing on customers and employees and following good business sense to grow the business right. It’s working, and we’d like to tell you about it.
