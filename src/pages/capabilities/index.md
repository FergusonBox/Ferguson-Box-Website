### Platen Die Cutter<a id="platen-die-cutter"></a> 

Our flatbed die cutter creates specialty products such as Litho-labeled risers, bases, trays, and intricate die cuts. Tolerances are much tighter for a flatbed die cutter which allows us to create unique designs for our customers. Flatbed die cutters have the capability to use matrix and other rule combinations that are limited or unavailable with rotary die cutters.
